# Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter

## IDE Support
In order to get IDE-Support for Vue3 we use Volar. To set it up, have a look at the guide [linked here](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/getting-started/quick-start#prerequisites).

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install

pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:
